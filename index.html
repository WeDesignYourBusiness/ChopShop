      <p>
        As a child, I was always fascinated about what the good life was. I wanted wealth & success from a young age, yet never really knew what 'success' was. I just knew I had to work hard at whatever it was.  I was always very into Hip-Hop music & culture, I think that’s what made me realize that there was more to life than just working a regular job. By looking up to guys like Jay Z, Puffy, Dame Dash, & Russell Simmons, I knew I wanted to be a mogul when I got older. I knew I would make history in whatever path I chose.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I hustled my whole life & truly considered myself an entrepreneur by the 6th grade. I remember learning that word when I was 10 & desired to embody the ideals of it right away. I sold c&y & my turkey sandwiches to my classmates.  I attended George Wingate high school with the same entrepreneurial spirit; at this point I got into clothes. Wanting to be 'fly', but that’s also because of my parents.  They taught me the power in dressing for success. I grew an eye for future trends & made sure my fit always stood out.  I had no idea what I actually wanted to do in life; but after being around a couple of Friday lunchroom cyphers & helping some friends get studio time, I felt like the music industry was my path. At 15 I realized I wanted to be a mogul in the music industry.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        After enjoying my teen years, it became time to choose a college. I didn’t plan on attending or even finishing. I wasn’t really interested in the college application process because I genuinely did not care, I was pretty much going for my mother. I chose three private schools, three SUNY & five CUNY schools. I visited St. John’s University & Pace University. Seeing the diversity at St. John’s seemed cool to me, & I decided this is where I would study.  Upon acceptance my initial goal was to attend for a year or two, strike rich & drop out. However that didn’t go as planned.  My college years were cool, I spent some time hanging around campus, working corporate jobs, & trying to finesse my way into the music industry. Towards the start of my last semester, & my 21st birthday, I felt fatigued of working for corporations. So I suddenly quit without any plans of going back. I ended up interning for an entertainment lawyer who taught me a lot of hip-hop history & gave me sound life & professional advice. I credit him for getting me ready for the real, REAL world.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        After my last semester I still helped the entertainment lawyer part-time, but I took advantage of this time to travel & see some of the world.  My travels took me to LA, Austin, Philly, London & Trinidad & Tobago.  I believe traveling cultured me, I got to see the world. Seeing how other people lived really expanded my mind to understanding the necessity of being a travelled, well rounded man if I was to be a mogul.  After my last voyage, I told my mom I would look for a real job. At the time I didn’t get an industry job & the job search was strenuous. Still dabbling in the music business with some artists, I was trying to get a real stable job. After listening to all my friends complain about their jobs, & taking notice of all the people that couldn’t get a job in the industry they wanted. I realized I did not want to be in that circumstance & reminisced about the little boy hustlin’ c&y in 6th grade & envisioned myself being a mogul for real.  I took heed to all the millennial hustlers making moves & I was inspired by their drive to make their own moves, I wanted to know the in’s & outs of what they did. Why were they able to do it & others stuck to society's norm? I felt like I should share their story, I built Chop Shop for this reason.  I want to show people that their is hope in fueling their dreams. We can all be successful.
